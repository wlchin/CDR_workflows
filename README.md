This repository contains the snakemake workflows required to generate the results in the CDR manuscript. It is strongly recommended that you create a virtual enviroment for the install. Whilst not required for CDR, scanpy and bbknn are both required to generate the diagrams in workflow.

Recommended steps:
1. Install scanpy
2. Install bbknn
3. Install CDR with pyPI

   pip install pyCDR
