# Spectral detection of condition-specific biological pathways in single-cell gene expression data.

This repository contains the snakemake workflows required to generate the results in the CDR manuscript. It is strongly recommended that you run these workflows within a virtual enviroment. 

# Recommended dependencies:

Whilst not required for CDR, scanpy, bbknn and enrichment_utils are both required to generate the diagrams in workflow. Please refer to the [CDR page](https://github.com/wlchin/pycdr)for additional installation information.
